# lorem-html

Hello, welcome in my little random LOREM HTML project 😁.

I hosted it here, on this repository's GitHub pages : [https://leopenaguin.github.io/lorem-html/](https://leopenaguin.github.io/lorem-html/)

> I just needed a tool like this one and I usually think that **Lorem Ipsum generators** are ugly and too simple so I created **my own one** ! (Also I was bored, I'm sure it was a big reason too).

What I used :
- Vuejs
- The Vue-CLI
- Scss
- the lorem-ipsum npm package
- the prettify-html npm package
- The highlight.js npm package
- The serviceWorkerLoader for webpack
- Visual studio code

That's it 😁 You can visit my little blog [here](http://codebear.info) !
